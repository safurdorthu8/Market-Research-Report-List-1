<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SPE Cartridge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reversed-Phase</li><li>Ion-Exchange</li><li>Normal Phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>SPE (Solid Phase Extraction) cartridges are specialized tools used in sample preparation for analytical chemistry. The reversed-phase market focuses on non-polar to moderately polar analytes, utilizing a hydrophobic stationary phase to retain compounds while allowing polar solvents to wash through. Ion-exchange cartridges target charged analytes, facilitating their retention through electrostatic interactions. In contrast, the normal phase market separates polar compounds using a polar stationary phase and non-polar solvents, allowing for effective separation based on polarity differences.</p></p>
